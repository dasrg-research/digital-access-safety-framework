## Overview

The **Digital Access & Safety Framework** is a neutral, informational framework designed to help explain:

- Common **online access issues**
- Recurring **impersonation and redirection risks**
- Practical **user-safety signals** observed across public web environments

This framework is intended for **educational and editorial reference only**.  
It does **not** provide official access, account support, or service endorsements.

---

## Scope & Principles

### What this framework covers
- Publicly observable access failures (DNS, ISP filtering, browser/session conflicts)
- Redirection and gateway patterns visible to end users
- Impersonation risk signals commonly found on copycat or misleading pages
- Safety-first decision rules for users encountering uncertain login flows

### What this framework does NOT do
- Provide official login links or service instructions
- Request or handle passwords, OTP codes, or payment details
- Represent any operator, platform, or commercial service
- Offer legal, financial, or account-recovery advice

---

## Framework A: Access Issue Taxonomy

Access problems typically fall into one or more of the following categories:

### 1. Network-Level Factors
- ISP or regional filtering
- DNS resolution inconsistencies
- Routing instability or packet loss
- Temporary maintenance windows

**User-visible signals:**
- Page timeout or blank screen
- Domain resolves on one network but not another
- Intermittent accessibility

---

### 2. Browser / Session-Level Factors
- Corrupted cookies or local storage
- Redirect loops caused by stale sessions
- Conflicts with browser extensions or privacy tools

**User-visible signals:**
- Endless redirects
- Repeated login prompts
- Page loads differently in incognito mode

---

### 3. Device / Application Factors
- WebView limitations inside apps
- Forced update prompts
- Permission traps

**User-visible signals:**
- Page only opens inside a specific app
- Unexpected install requests
- Repeated permission popups

---

## Framework B: Impersonation Risk Signals

The following signals frequently appear on impersonation or copycat pages:

- Look-alike domains (extra letters, swapped characters, misleading subdomains)
- Multi-hop redirects across unrelated domains
- Urgent messaging (“verify now”, “account blocked”)
- Countdown timers or pressure language
- Requests for OTP codes via chat or pop-ups

These signals do **not** confirm malicious intent on their own, but their presence should increase caution.

---

## Framework C: Safety “Stop Rules”

Users are advised to **stop and reassess** if any of the following occur:

1. A page asks for passwords or OTP codes outside a secure form
2. A site forces unknown app or extension installations
3. The domain changes unexpectedly during a login attempt
4. Support contacts initiate communication and request credentials
5. Instructions pressure immediate action without verification

When unsure, waiting and verifying is safer than proceeding.

---

## Methodology

This framework is based on:
- Publicly visible webpages and announcements
- Repeated access patterns reported by users
- Comparative observation across multiple platforms
- Non-intrusive analysis (no private data collection)

No user credentials, personal identifiers, or private communications are collected or stored.

---

## Intended Use

This framework may be referenced by:
- Independent informational websites
- Editorial safety guides
- Access troubleshooting explanations
- Educational or research discussions
